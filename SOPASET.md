Hello,

we have now developed a tool to recognize the connected scanners with their IP addresses under Linux. Details can be found under the following link.

We have also started with the integration of the IP address assignment. Details can be found under the link:

We plan, as promised, to finish this work (allocation of IP addresses) by the end of next week.
